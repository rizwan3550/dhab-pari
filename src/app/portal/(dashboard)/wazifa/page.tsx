/**
 * The Taleemi Wazifa application.
 *
 * This form is printed and carried to the house. The committee sits in the
 * courtyard and goes through it line by line, so it asks what can actually be
 * checked there — how many brothers and sisters are studying, at which school,
 * what the fee is, who works and whether they are paid by the day or the
 * month, whether there is a long illness in the house.
 *
 * "Siblings studying: 3" is not checkable. Three named children, two at the
 * village school and one travelling to Chakwal, with fees against each, is.
