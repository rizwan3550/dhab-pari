 * A translated string, usable from inside a Server Component.

 * The public pages are Server Components with `revalidate`, so their HTML is
 * rendered once and shared by every visitor — the language cannot be baked in,
 * because the next reader may want the other one. A hook is not available
 * there either.
 *
 * This is the seam: the server renders the page and the layout, and drops these
 * in wherever words appear. Each one is a tiny client island that asks the
 * LocaleProvider what to say. The cached HTML stays language-neutral and the
 * words resolve in the browser.
 *
 *   <T k="home.ongoingProjects" />
 *
 * `fallback` is what to show if the key is missing — pass the original English
 * so a forgotten dictionary entry degrades to the old wording rather than to a
 * raw key in front of a villager.
